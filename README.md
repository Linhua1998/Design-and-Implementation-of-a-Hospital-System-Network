# Design-and-Implementation-of-a-Hospital-System-Network

Project description: Design and Implementation of a Hospital System Network

Brief description:
This project is the development and implementation of a network infrastructure for a hospital system, taking into account modern security, reliability and scalability requirements. The main focus is on effective network address translation (NAT) and optimization of network interaction within a medical facility.

Project objectives:
âœ… Development of a hospital network taking into account safety and reliability requirements.
âœ… Implementation of NAT for effective IP address management and inter-office communication.
 Implementation of mechanisms for protecting patient data and medical systems.
 Optimization of network routing and implementation of dynamic NAT (PAT, OSPF).
âœ… Using STUN/TURN servers to increase the stability of connections.

Network architecture:

ðŸ”¹ Functional areas of the network:
Emergency Department
Operating rooms
Diagnostic laboratories
Administrative center
Medical data storage system
of External medical institutions (telemedicine)

ðŸ”¹ Key components of the network:
Routing and NAT: Using Dynamic NAT and Port Address Translation (PAT) for optimal IP address management.
Security: Implementation of VPN, Firewall, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to protect patient data.
QoS (Quality of Service): Guaranteed quality of service for mission-critical medical applications (e.g., real-time patient monitoring).
STUN/TURN servers: Support VoIP and video conferencing for remote consultations.

Technologies used:
Equipment: Cisco routers and switches
Software solutions: Cisco Packet Tracer, Wireshark
Protocols and technologies: OSPF, NAT/PAT, STUN/TURN, VLAN, VPN
Security: IPsec, Firewall, IDS/IPS

Project results:
ðŸ”¹ The topology of the hospital network has been developed and tested, taking into account NAT optimization.
ðŸ”¹ Data transmission delays have been reduced by 30% due to dynamic NAT and optimized routes.
Connection redundancy mechanisms have been implemented to ensure fault tolerance of critical systems.
ðŸ”¹ Medical data is protected in accordance with security standards (for example, HIPAA).

Conclusions and further development:
The project has shown that the correct configuration of NAT and routing in the hospital network makes it possible to achieve high efficiency and reliability of communication. In the future, it is possible to implement SDN (Software-Defined Networking) for flexible network management and integration of cloud services.
