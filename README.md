# Design-and-Implementation-of-a-Hospital-System-Network
This project analyzed Network Address Translation (NAT) technology and its impact on the performance and security of corporate networks.

This project analyzed Network Address Translation (NAT) technology and its impact on the performance and security of corporate networks. The project is aimed at finding and implementing NAT optimization methods using modern hardware and software solutions, as well as studying the impact of various types of NAT on the network infrastructure of enterprises.              

Key tasks:
 A study of the principles of NAT and its varieties (Static NAT, Dynamic NAT, PAT).
âœ… Analysis of the impact of NAT on network latency, bandwidth, and security.
 Development and testing of NAT optimization methods in corporate networks.
âœ… NAT implementation in three different network scenarios:
  - Internal corporate network
  - Campus network
  - Hospital network infrastructure
  - Conducting a comparative analysis of NAT optimization methods and their impact on network performance.

Technologies and tools:
Hardware solutions: Cisco routers and switches
Software tools: Cisco Packet Tracer, Wireshark
Protocols and technologies: OSPF, STUN/TURN, VPN, MPLS, IPv6
Programming languages: Python (for network log analysis and test automation)

Project results:
ðŸ”¹ The main NAT problems related to loss of performance and difficulty in circumventing restrictions have been identified.
NAT optimization methods have been developed and tested, including the use of specialized hardware and software solutions.
The effectiveness of a hybrid approach (a combination of hardware and software methods) for optimizing NAT in corporate networks has been proven.
Recommendations for improving the network architecture of enterprises, taking into account NAT, are proposed.

Conclusions and prospects:
The project has shown that NAT optimization can significantly improve network efficiency, reduce delays, and improve network security. In the future, it is possible to explore the integration of NAT with promising technologies such as SDN (Software-Defined Networking) and cloud services.
