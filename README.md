# Design-and-Implementation-of-a-Hospital-System-Network
This project analyzed Network Address Translation (NAT) technology and its impact on the performance and security of corporate networks.

The project has shown that NAT optimization can significantly improve network efficiency, reduce delays, and improve network security. In the future, it is possible to explore the integration of NAT with promising technologies such as SDN (Software-Defined Networking) and cloud services.
